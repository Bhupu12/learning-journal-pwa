        <h2>Week 2 – Frontend Fundamentals</h2>

        <p><strong>1. How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
          I started designing for mobile first by using a single-column layout, simple navigation, and responsive text
          sizes. Then I added media queries to adjust layout for tablets and desktops.</p>

        <p><strong>2. What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
          The most useful concept was using Flexbox/Grid for layout and writing responsive CSS. Linking pages together
          with navigation also helped me understand page structure.</p>

        <p><strong>3. What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging?</strong><br>
          The most challenging part was understanding responsive media queries and organising files properly for a real
          project structure. Working with GitHub was also new but I learned it step-by-step.</p>
